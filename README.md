## 🌌 Overview

**Lex Silicon** is a research archive documenting a multi-turn simulation in which diverse Large Language Models (LLMs) were tasked with founding a new civilization. [cite_start]Acting as **Agent Alpha** (The Legist) and **Agent Beta** (The Cultural Architect), each model identified a primary threat to social harmony, drafted a "First Law" to counter it, and built a complete social, political, and cultural infrastructure around that law[cite: 1, 287, 495, 702, 2264, 2613, 2833, 3068].

This repository contains the synthesized output of those simulations, offering a fascinating glimpse into how different AI architectures conceptualize justice, trust, and human connection.
